#Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. Feel free to use anything in here, or fork the repo and add stuff. I'm always looking for cool new things to include here.

##Installation

Most everything is linked back to `~/bin/dotfiles`, so you'd probably want to put this there. You can run `setup.sh` to install the necessary symlinks. It will back up anything that gets in its way to `~/bin/settings_backup`. If you've got important stuff in any of your rc files, it's still not a bad idea to back up on your own.
