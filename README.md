#Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. Feel free to use anything in here, or fork the repo and add stuff. I'm always looking for cool new things to include here.

##Installation

There was a `setup.sh`, but I got tired of keeping it up and it was just easier to make a list.

1. Back everything up to `~/bin/settings_backup`
2. Copy `bash_profile`
3. Symlinks
	* `.bashrc`
	* `.tm_properties`
	* `.ssh/config`
	* `.vimrc` & `.vim`
	* `.zshrc`
	* `~/Library/Application Settings/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User` â†’ `~/bin/dotfiles/sublime`
